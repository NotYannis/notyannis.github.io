      <text>We did this project during our studies, and I worked on it at full time during two months with a bigger team - we were ten,
			with three programers (including me). We did this game on Unity. I did a lot of gameplay, I learned a lot about Unity UI (the smarthpone
			app is a big UI), and I also learned about team managing, since I was working with two other programmer, and was their "lead" (mostly
			distributing work and refering to other specialties).</text>
