      <description>Honorable mention for the video game student category at the "Pixel Challenge"</description>
      <info>
        We won the second place of the Pixel Challenge, a game jam in Quebec City.
        I was the only programer in a team of five people. We did the game in Unity.
        The game was rewarded for its "great originality" and "craziness". We're kinda proud about it.
