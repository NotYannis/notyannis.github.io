    I'm a gameplay programer student at CNAM-ENJMIN, France. I use Unity and Unreal Engine.
    I love to work with a team, I aim to make my projects a beautiful road of social encounters and a great human experience.
    I love to code gameplay, and I also like to participate on other game making aspects, such as game design or team organisation.

        Little seeds is a three month student project. It's a relaxing VR game wich take place in a dreamed garden.
        It was done on Unreal Engine 4.16. I made a live growing tree algorithm, using the fresh new procedural mesh library on UE4.
        As a programer, I also work on optimisation, VR usability, tree generation.
        Outside of my programer work, I did some game design, and I organized the last sprint of the team.

      <description>Honorable mention for the video game student category at the "Pixel Challenge"</description>
      <info>
        We won the second place of the Pixel Challenge, a game jam in Quebec City.
        I was the only programer in a team of five people. We did the game in Unity.
        The game was rewarded for its "great originality" and "craziness". We're kinda proud about it.
