  <history>
    This game was made with Unity. I did it with 4 friends during the Pixel Challenge, a 47 hours game jam in Quebec city. I was the only programmer.
    I did the game system, the sounds and graphic integration, but also some game design. It was the smoothest game jam I've ever made. I even had enough
    time to code a cool end and a nice menu !
