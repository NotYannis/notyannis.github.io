  <description>Drowned is an ambiant-horrific game where you have to sneak between sea monsters to get out of the ocean</description>

  <history>
    This game was made using Unreal Engine 4. It was made during the Enjam 2017, an intern jam for ENJMIN students. We were two programmer on the project.
    I did the AI of sea monsters with the UE AI tool, as well as a little tool for game designer to help them make monster's patrols.
