  <history>
      This game was made on Unity. I was the only programmer in a team of 8 students.
      Basically, the game is a hidden object game :
      you find an object, it unlocks questions, one question will unlock an object, and so on.
      I had to make the game system, but also all the graphic and sound integration. Since the 
      game system was simple, the game jam ran smoothly, and I had time to sleep and debug the game !
